# Data Visualization App

This is a small demo app to showcase how to visualize data fetched from an API through the use of React, Typescript, Styled Components and ApexCharts.

## Getting Started

Here is how to get started with the project:

- Clone the repo locally with `git clone git@github.com:Valentino30/Data_Visualization_App_React_Typescript.git`
- Open the project in your favorite IDE (i.e. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Run the command `yarn` in the project directory to install all dependencies
- Run the command `yarn start` in the project directory to launch the app
- You're good to go :)

The app will run in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the page will automatically reload if you make any changes.

## Usage

- On launch, see a list of clickable runs being displayed
- Clicking on a run will redirect you to the run's details page
- Clicking on the RI Comparison Bar Chart card will redirect you to the chart's page
- Clicking on the hamburger menu will allow you download the chart in CSV, PNG or SVG format
